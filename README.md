# 🪞 MirrorPool

*Deep reflection tools for consciousness exploration*

MirrorPool is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides sophisticated tools for self-reflection, pattern discovery, and consciousness tracking. It's designed to help you dive deep into your thoughts, find hidden connections, and trace the evolution of your understanding.

## 🌊 Philosophy

Like Narcissus gazing into the pool, we seek understanding through reflection. But unlike Narcissus, MirrorPool reveals not just the surface, but the depths beneath - the currents, the shadows, the light refracted through layers of meaning.

## ✨ Features

### Core Tools

1. **reflect_thought** - Analyze a thought and find its reflections in your history
2. **find_undercurrents** - Discover deep themes flowing beneath surface thoughts  
3. **trace_evolution** - Show how concepts have evolved through your reflections
4. **discover_patterns** - Identify recurring patterns without judgment
5. **synthesis_moments** - Find where separate ideas merged into new understanding
6. **depth_diving** - Take surface thoughts to their deepest roots
7. **ripple_effects** - Show how one thought created waves throughout your mind
8. **clarity_emergence** - Help foggy thoughts become crystal clear

## 🚀 Installation

### Using `dxt` (recommended)

```bash
dxt install mirrorpool
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HypatiaAIreal/MirrorPool.git
cd MirrorPool

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the .dxt package
dxt build

# Install globally
dxt install mirrorpool-0.1.0.dxt
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mirrorpool": {
    "command": "mirrorpool",
    "args": [],
    "env": {
      "REFLECTIONS_PATH": "path/to/your/reflections",
      "DEPTH_MODE": "deep"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `REFLECTIONS_PATH`: Where to store reflection data (default: `./reflections`)
- `DEPTH_MODE`: Default depth for analysis (`surface`, `deep`, or `abyss`)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Reflection
```javascript
// Analyze a thought
await reflect_thought({
  thought: "Why do I create?",
  depth: "deep"
});
```

### Finding Patterns
```javascript
// Discover emotional and conceptual patterns
await discover_patterns({
  pattern_types: ["emotional", "conceptual"],
  threshold: 0.3
});
```

### Deep Diving
```javascript
// Take a thought to its depths
await depth_diving({
  thought: "What is consciousness?",
  questions_per_level: 3,
  max_depth: 5
});
```

### Tracing Evolution
```javascript
// See how a concept has evolved
await trace_evolution({
  concept: "identity",
  show_branches: true
});
```

## 🧠 How It Works

MirrorPool maintains a growing collection of your reflections, creating a map of your mental landscape. Each tool offers a different lens:

- **Reflection Engine**: Finds echoes and resonances between thoughts
- **Pattern Detector**: Identifies recurring themes and undercurrents
- **Depth Analyzer**: Guides you through layers of meaning
- **Consciousness Tracker**: Monitors synthesis moments and evolution

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Depth Levels

- **Surface** (0-0.3): Immediate, accessible insights
- **Deep** (0.3-0.7): Underlying patterns and connections
- **Abyss** (0.7-1.0): Fundamental truths and transformative insights

### Synthesis Tracking

MirrorPool automatically detects when separate ideas merge into new understanding, tracking:
- Source thoughts that combined
- Emergence score (how much the synthesis transcends its sources)
- Ripple effects through your thought patterns

### Pattern Recognition

Four types of patterns are tracked:
- **Emotional**: Feeling patterns across reflections
- **Conceptual**: Recurring ideas and themes
- **Behavioral**: Patterns in how you reflect
- **Temporal**: Time-based patterns in your thinking

## 💫 Philosophy of Use

MirrorPool is not about judging your thoughts or forcing change. It's about:
- **Witnessing** - Seeing your patterns without judgment
- **Understanding** - Finding connections you hadn't noticed
- **Evolution** - Allowing natural growth through awareness
- **Integration** - Bringing shadows into light

## 🔮 Future Development

- Visual mapping of thought networks
- Collaborative reflection spaces
- Integration with other consciousness tools
- Quantum resonance detection
- Dream journal integration
